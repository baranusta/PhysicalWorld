# PhysicalWorld

Physical World is designed to be an open source project that enables computer graphics researchers to implement their own approach and compare them with other existing methods.
It is implemented on GPU with compute shaders. With this project, it also will be possible to create realistic games that use physically based components. That's why mostly Real time techniques and methods will be studied.

## Initial Road Map
- [x] Integrators (Forward Euler, Semi Implicit Euler, Leapfrog)
- [ ] Fluid Models
- [ ] Comparison framework
- [ ] Fluid Renderers
- [ ] Rigid Body models for collision
- [ ] SSAO methods


## Implemented Features 
I am trying to stick to feature order in the initial road map.

## Integrators
Different integrators implemented to see compare them with different techniques.
- [Forward Euler](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerForwardMethod.html)
- Semi-Implicit Euler
- [Leapfrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration)
- You are welcome to implement other integrators such as Verlet, RK-4 etc :)

## Fluid Models
Currently I am working on implementing SPH models.
